    "content": "<p>Sachin Tendulkar's 241* at the 2004 Sydney Test is remembered not for flashy strokes, but for pure determination. After falling repeatedly to deliveries outside off stump in earlier games, Sachin made a bold decision: he would not play a single attacking shot through the off-side.</p><p>Across 613 minutes at the crease, he stuck to that promise. No cover drives. No square cuts. Nothing through the region where he normally dominated. Australia kept bowling wide, hoping to trigger a mistake, but Sachin refused to chase.</p><p>He built the innings with straight drives, nudges, flicks, and an unshakeable mindset. By the time he reached 241*, the bowlers were mentally drained.</p><p>This innings remains one of cricket's greatest examples of adjusting technique to overcome adversity.</p>",
